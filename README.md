# Wave-Analysis
Code written by Yuval Orsher for analysis of waves of activity in neural data. There are 4 main script files each with specific tasks it deals with,
and a folder of helper functions for calculating and plotting relevant variables.
A lot of the code relies on corticodes' [NET repository](https://github.com/neural-electrophysiology-tool-team/NET) which handles the experimental data directly.
