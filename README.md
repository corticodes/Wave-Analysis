# Wave-Analysis
Code written by Yuval Orsher for analysis of waves of activity in neural data. Most relevent are the helper functions in 'small functions and plots'.
Usage examples can be found in the scripts.
A lot of the code relies on corticodes' [NET repository](https://github.com/neural-electrophysiology-tool-team/NET) which handles the experimental data directly.
