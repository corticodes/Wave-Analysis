function C = outerProduct(A,B)
%OUTERPROD returnes the outer product of matrices A,B
%   C is size(A,1)*size(B,1) by size(A,2)*size(B,2) matrix in which 
%   each member of A is multiplied by the matrix B, so basically B is
%   copied numel(A) times, each time multiplies by a different member of A
%   and placed where this member was places.
%   For example, if A=[1 2 3;4,5,6;7,8,9] and B=ones(3) then
%   C is
