function [nChInWave,channels,times] = countContinousCrossings(allCrossings,En,maxTempDist,channels,times)
%COUNTCONTINOUSCROSSINGS is a recursive function that counts how many 
%channels have crossings that are connected (in space and time), i.e. how 
%many channels participate in a particular wave. 
%   Input:
%       - allCrossings: all channel's crossings times (one of the 4 
%         matrices given by getHilbertCrossings)
%       - En: channel layout 
%       - maxTempDist: the maximal time window allowed for two neighbors to
%       have crossings
%       - channels,times are arrays to keep track of the wave crossings 
%       found. AS INPUT, THE STARTING SEED SHOULD BE GIVEN (i.e. channels
%       should contain the seed channel and times the seed's time).
%   Output:
%       - nChInWave: Number of channels that had a countinous crossings 
%       from one another
%       - channels, times are arrays containing the channels that had
%       crossings and the time they had it

%TODO: - Maybe set  maxTempDist as default and allow change via varargin
%      - Currently looking only at horizontal and vertical neighbours.
%      Maybe diagonal should be added?
