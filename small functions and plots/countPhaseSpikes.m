function neuronPhaseCount = countPhaseSpikes(TIC,spikePhase)
%countPhaseSpikes returns a nNeuronsX360 matrix with the number

%neuron in TIC
%   Input:
%   TIC are the spikes to be counted. It is 3 by nNeurons formed by 
%   combining t,ic. Every column is a spike, and rows are time,channel and 
%   neuron number.
%   spikePhase are all the phases in which the channel oscilation was when
%   the neuron fired
