function ALSA=calcALSA(spikingRate,varargin)
%CALCALSA calculates the average local spiking activity (ALSA) for every
%channel. For every channel ch and for every sample s ALSA is defined by
%the weighted average of nNearestChannels. If En is given, nearest
%neighbors are locally adjacent channels and nNearestChannels must be
%either 4 (4 nearest neighbors,default) or 8 (4 nearest and 4 next nearest
%neighbors). If En is not given, the weighted average is calculated using
%nChs2average (default: 2) above and below channel ch (with cyclic channel counting) 

%   INPUT:
%       - spikingRate (nChXnSamples) - spiking rate to average spatially.
%       - Varargs (given as 'Name','Value' pairs):
%           - nChs2average - if En is not given as varargin, the weighted 
%           average is calculated using nChs2average above and below 
%           channel ch (with cyclic channel counting). Default is 2.
%           - Weights: if En is not given as varargin, this will be the
%           vector of averaging weights. Must be of length 
%           nChs2average*2+1. Default is gausswin(nChs2average*2+1)/sum(gausswin(nChs2average*2+1))
%           - En - Channel Layout. If given averaging will be over nearest 
%           neighbors.
%           - nNearestChannels - number of channels to average over. Can be
%           either 4 (default) or 8 (4nn+4nnn). weights are 1 for the
%           center channel, 1/2 for nn and 1/4 for nnn (normalized)
%   OUTPUT:
